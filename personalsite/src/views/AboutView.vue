      As early as high school, I began developing a deep interest in coding and graphic design,
      frequently participating in online forums. This passion only grew stronger in 2020, when I
      spent countless hours exploring platforms like Squarespace and Webflow, before diving into
      learning HTML and CSS. <br><br>
      After six months of dedicated practice, I realized just how much I
      enjoyed web development. Since then, I've had the privilege of applying my skills in
      real-world projects. I've built software for a
      <strong class="font-bold !opacity-100 text-slate-300">health tech startup Mazecare</strong>
      and helped several companies establish their online presences. <br>
      <br>
      When i m not coding, I'm usually playing Dota 2, and following e-sports, and going through the painful journey of being a Manchester United Fan.
